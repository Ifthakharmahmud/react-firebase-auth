             <p>We acknowledge the pervasive systemic racism present in the world, and in today’s maternal health system. We stand with people of color and are committed to providing judgement-free, equitable healthcare in which the people we serve are entrusted to drive decision-making, listened to, supported, and treated with respect. We welcome everyone without discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, language, religion, sex, age, ability, marital status, or payment source. We commit to making space for each person’s unique body, preferences, culture, and history, and holding ourselves accountable to building an anti-racist, multi-cultural organization.</p>
